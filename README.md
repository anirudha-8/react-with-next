# 🚀 React with Next.js: My Learning Journey

Welcome to my **React with Next.js** learning journey! This repository will serve as a log of my experiences and projects while I learn how to build powerful React applications with Next.js. 🌟

## ⚡ Why Next.js?

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Optimize performance by pre-rendering pages on the server.

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Build static sites with great SEO and fast load times.

- **API Routes**: Easily create serverless functions as API endpoints.

- **Routing**: Built-in file-based routing system.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- ⚛️ **React.js**

- 🔄 **Next.js**

- 💻 **JavaScript (ES6+)**

- 🖌️ **CSS Modules & Styled Components**

- 📦 **Node.js & npm**

- 🧪 **Jest & React Testing Library**

## 🎯 Learning Plan

I’ll focus on mastering the following key areas with Next.js:

1. **Project Setup**: Setting up a Next.js app from scratch.

2. **File-based Routing**: Understanding the routing system and dynamic routes.

3. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Learning how SSR works and when to use it.

4. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Generating static pages with data-fetching.

5. **API Routes**: Building serverless API routes directly in Next.js.

6. **Styling**: Using CSS Modules and styled-components with Next.js.
